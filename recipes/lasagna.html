    <ul>
        <li>9 whole-wheat lasagna noodles</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>            
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>            
        <li>1 pound ground turkey breast</li>             
        <li>3 cups tomato sauce</li>             
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>             
        <li>3 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>             
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>             
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>             
        <li>6 cups chopped fresh spinach</li>             
        <li>2 cups fat-free ricotta cheese</li>             
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>             
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 2 minutes. Add ground turkey and cook 5 to 7 minutes more, stirring to break up any large chunks of meat. Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder. Simmer for 2 minutes and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine spinach, ricotta, and nutmeg in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>To assemble, arrange 3 noodles lengthwise in the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread with 1/3 the ricotta mixture, 1/3 of the turkey mixture, and 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat layers, ending with remaining mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
